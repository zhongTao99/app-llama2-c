Standalone, Binary Portable, Bootable Llama 2

The primary objective of Llama 2 Everywhere (L2E) is to ensure its compatibility across a wide range of devices, from booting on repurposed chromebooks discarded by school districts to high-density unikernel deployments in enterprises. 

We believe that in future by harnessing a legion of small specialized LLMs with modest hardware requirements which are networked, distributed, and self-coordinated, L2E has the potential to democratize access to AI and unlock collective intelligence that surpasses that of a single large LLM.

The current compelling use case of L2E involves training small models on diverse textual sources, including textbooks, open books, and comprehensive corpora like the SlimPajama corpus. These trained models can be deployed using L2E, enabling them to run as bootable instances on outdated school computers. This deployment scenario proves particularly valuable in school libraries or classrooms where internet connectivity is limited or unavailable, serving as an information gateway for students without constant reliance on the internet.

By pursuing the vision of Llama 2 Everywhere, we aim to create an inclusive AI ecosystem that can adapt to diverse environments and empower individuals and communities on a global scale.

My research goal is to train models using various hardware telemetry data with the hope that the models learn to interpret sensor inputs and control actuators based on the insights they glean from the sensor inputs. This research direction may open up exciting possibilities in fields such as automation, space, robotics and IoT, where L2E can play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between AI and physical systems.

I will be mirrorring the progress of https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c every week, add portability, performance improvements and convenience features such as a web interface which certainly would not fit in the upstream do to the minimalistic elegance requirements there.

# Features

### NEW - Unikernel Build

Have you ever wanted to boot and inference a herd of 1000's of Virtual baby Llama 2 models on big ass enterprise servers? No? Well, now you can!

![l2e_unik](https://github.com/trholding/llama2.c/assets/93451215/415f00b4-25ed-4c30-b619-1c3404ababee)

Just do the following to build:

```bash
make run_unik_qemu_x86_64
```

Please note that the requirements - unikraft and musl sources - will automatically get cloned before building.

Once the build completes, (takes a while), run L2E like this:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256m -accel kvm -kernel build/L2E_qemu-x86_64
```

You can also run with -nographic option to directly interact in terminal.

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256m -accel kvm -kernel build/L2E_qemu-x86_64 -nographic
```
Download and try this and the cosmocc build in the latest release.

## Portability Features

+ Single Executable that runs on any x86_64 OS (cosmocc builds)
- [x] GNU Linux 
- [x] GNU/Systemd
- [x] *BSD (NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)
- [x] XNU's Not UNIX (Mac)
- [x] Bare Metal Boot (BIOS & EFI) (Not fully functional yet but almost...)
- [x] Windows

## llama2.c

</p>

A friendly fork of the excellent [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c)

The original repository offers a full-stack solution for training and inferring the Llama 2 LLM architecture using PyTorch and a simple 500-line C file. The focus is on minimalism and simplicity, and the repo is a young project that is still being actively developed. The author recommends looking at the TinyStories paper for inspiration, as small LLMs can have strong performance in narrow domains. The C inference engine in run.c was the main focus of the project, and the Llama 2 architecture is hard-coded with no dependencies.

## Feel the Magic

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trholding/llama2.c.git
cd llama2.c
make runfast
wget https://huggingface.co/karpathy/tinyllamas/resolve/main/stories15M.bin
./run stories15M.bin
```
You can also prompt the model with a prefix:

```bash
./run stories42M.bin -t 0.8 -n 256 -i "A big dog"
```

When prompting, the temperature and steps parameters are needed since we use simple positional arguments.

**Output**

> A big dog named Zip. He loved to run and play in the sun. He was a happy dog. One day, Zip saw a little bird on the ground. The bird looked helpless. Zip wanted to help the bird. He ran to the bird and lay down next to it. Zip and the bird became friends. They played together every day. Zip would carry the bird to play in the trees. The bird would fly around, and Zip would bark. They were very happy together.


## Models

The original author trained a series of small models on TinyStories, which took a few hours to train on their setup. The 110M model took around 24 hours. The models are hosted on huggingface hub:

| model | dim | n_layers | n_heads | max context length | parameters | val loss | download
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OG | 288 | 6 | 6 | 256 | 15M | 1.072 | [stories15M.bin](https://huggingface.co/karpathy/tinyllamas/resolve/main/stories15M.bin) |
| 42M| 512 | 8 | 8 | 1024 | 42M | 0.847 | [stories42M.bin](https://huggingface.co/karpathy/tinyllamas/resolve/main/stories42M.bin) |
| 110M| 768 | 12 | 12 | 1024 | 110M | 0.760 | [stories110M.bin](https://huggingface.co/karpathy/tinyllamas/resolve/main/stories110M.bin) |

The upstream project owner trained the llama2.c storyteller models on a 4X A100 40GB box provided by [Lambda labs](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud).

Quick note on sampling, the recommendation for good results is to use `-t 1.0 -p 0.9`, i.e. top-p sampling at 0.9 with temperature 1.0 (this is the default). To control the diversity of samples use either the temperature (i.e. vary `-t` between 0 and 1 and keep top-p off with `-p 0`) or the top-p value (i.e. vary `-p` between 0 and 1 and keep `-t 1`), but not both. Nice explainers on LLM sampling strategies include [this](https://peterchng.com/blog/2023/05/02/token-selection-strategies-top-k-top-p-and-temperature/), [this](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/controlling-generation-with-top-k-top-p) or [this](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).

```bash
./run llama2_7b.bin
```
A converted **Meta's Llama 2 7b** model can be inferenced at a slow speed.

## Usage

**Full Usage**

```bash
./run <checkpoint_file> -t [temperature] -s [steps] -b [buffertokens] -p [prompt]
```

Where 
 
 <checkpoint_file> is the **mandatory** checkpoint / model file.\
  E.g. `stories15M.bin` or `stories42M.bin` or `stories110M.bin`.
 
 -t is the *optional* temperature in the range `0.0` to `1.0` and a default of **0.9**.\
  `0` makes outputs with same or no prompt reproducible.
 
 -n is the *optional* number of steps in the range `1` to `256` and a default of **256**.\
  `0` sets it to context length of model.\
  This option defines the number of tokens to infer and output.
  
 -b is the *optional* number of tokens to buffer from a range 1 to context length and a default of **1**.\
  `0` sets it to context length of model.\
  This increases the interactive performance. Use values such as `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128` ... YMMV!
 
 -i is the *optional* input prompt such as `"A car"` to pass on to guide inference.\
  If omitted the model will infer on its own.

**Minimal Usage**

```bash
./run <checkpoint_file>
```

## Platforms

**Multi OS build**

`make cosmorun`

The binary will boot on baremetal and also run on any 64 Bit OS such as Linux, *BSD, Windows and slower on Aarch64 Mac & Linux.

Currently when used to boot, it won't be able to find the models. It's a toolchain issue with an anticipated fix.

The performance of this build is more than twice of the basic build.

**Linux**

Centos 7 / Amazon Linux 2018

`make rungnu` or `make runompgnu` to use openmp.

**Other Linux Distros / Mac**

`make runfast` or `make runomp` to use openmp.

**Windows**

Build on windows: 

`build_msvc.bat` in a Visual Studio Command Prompt 

The MSVC build will use openmp and max threads suitable for your CPU unless you set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` env.

Build on Linux and Windows:

`make win64` to use the mingw compiler toolchain.

## Performance

**Basic**

This build does not enable any optimizations.

```bash
make run
```
This can be used as baseline build against which performance of other builds can be compared.

**Fast**

This build enables basic performance boost with compiler provided optimizations.

```bash
make runfast
```
### Build wth Acceleration

**OpenMP**

This build enables acceleration via OpenMP

```bash
make run_cc_openmp
```

Requires [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) libraries and compiler with OpenMP support to be available on system.
E.g. `apt install clang libomp-dev` on ubuntu

When you run inference make sure to use OpenMP flags to set the number of threads, e.g.:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./run out/model.bin
```
More threads is not always better.

**OpenACC**

This build enables acceleration via OpenACC

```bash
make run_cc_openacc
```

Requires [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) libraries and compiler with OpenACC support to be available on system.

**OpenBLAS**

This build enables acceleration via OpenBLAS

```bash
make run_cc_openblas
```

Requires [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) to be installed on system.

**BLIS**

This build enables acceleration via BLIS

```bash
make run_cc_blis
```
Requires [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis) compiled with `./configure --enable-cblas -t openmp,pthreads auto` to be installed on system.

**Intel oneAPI MKL**

This build enables acceleration via Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library on x86_64 systems and Intel Mac OS - WIP

```bash
make run_cc_mkl
```
Requires [Intel oneAPI MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) to be installed on system.

**Arm Performance Library (ArmPL)**

This build enables acceleration via Arm Performance Library on ARM64 systems such as Linux or Mac OS - WIP

```bash
make run_cc_armpl
```
Requires [ArmPL](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Libraries) to be installed on system.

**Apple Accelerate**

This build enables BLAS acceleration via Apple Accelerate on Mac OS - Testing

```bash
make run_cc_mac_accel
```
Requires [Apple Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/) to be available on system.

Note: Needs testing.

**Generic CBLAS**

This build enables acceleration with any Netlib CBLAS interface compatible libraries

```bash
make run_cc_cblas
```

Requires any BLAS library with Netlib CBLAS interface such as [LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack) to be installed on system.

**CLBlast (GPU/OpenCL)**

This build enables tuned GPU acceleration via OpenCL with CLBlast

```bash
make run_cc_clblast
```

Requires [CLBlast](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast) compiled with `cmake -DNETLIB=ON` to be installed on system.

Note: Currently runs much slower than CPU! Requires investigation or memory I/O is a bottle neck on the test system.

## Portable Binary Build

Have you ever wanted to inference a baby Llama 2 model with a single executable on any OS or *as OS? No? Well, now you can!

By making use of the Cosmopolitan libc toolchain to build llama2.c we get the we can get those features.

Instructions

Get and build the comopolitan libc toolchain:

Follow instructions at https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan
